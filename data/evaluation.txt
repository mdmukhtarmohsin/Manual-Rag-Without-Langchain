Title: Evaluating RAG Systems
- Measure retrieval quality: recall@k, precision@k, and NDCG for ranking quality.
- For answer quality, use exact match, F1, or ROUGE-L depending on the task.
- Add a “no-answer” option: if context lacks evidence, the system should abstain.
- Reproducible evaluation needs a fixed dataset of questions and ground-truth citations.
