Title: Vector Databases 101
- A vector database stores embeddings (numeric vectors) and supports nearest neighbor search.
- Common index types include Flat (exact), IVF (inverted file for coarse quantization), and HNSW (graph-based).
- Cosine similarity is often used for normalized embeddings; inner product equals cosine when vectors are L2-normalized.
- FAISS is a popular library; IndexFlatIP is exact but can be slower on large corpora. IVF+PQ or HNSW improves scalability.
- Recall can be improved by re-ranking the top candidates with a more precise scorer.
- Hybrid retrieval combines dense semantic search with sparse keyword search like BM25.
