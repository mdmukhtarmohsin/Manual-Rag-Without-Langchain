Title: Hybrid Retrieval Tips
- Dense search uses embeddings to match meaning; sparse search uses keywords and term statistics (e.g., BM25).
- Score normalization helps merge scores from different sources. Min-max or z-score are common choices.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is robust: it rewards documents that rank well in any list.
- Alpha controls the balance: higher alpha favors dense similarity; lower alpha favors keyword matches.
- Overlapping chunks help reduce boundary issues; 500 tokens with 100 overlap is a reasonable starting point.
