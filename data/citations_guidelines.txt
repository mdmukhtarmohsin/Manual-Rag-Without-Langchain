Title: Grounded Answering and Citations
- Instruct the model: “Use ONLY the provided context; if unsure, say you don't know.”
- Require bracketed citations like [1], [2] tied to retrieved chunks.
- Short answers with precise quotes are often better than long, speculative text.
- Post-check the answer: verify each cited chunk actually supports the claim.
