Title: BM25 Basics
- BM25 ranks documents by term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length normalization.
- Tokenization quality matters: lowercase, remove stopwords, and keep alphanumerics for best results.
- BM25 excels when exact terms are important (e.g., error codes, names, API keys).
- Combine BM25 with dense retrieval to cover both exact and semantic matches.
